# CGH-SUTD DVSA Case Study: Asthma Analysis using BRFSS 2021

This repository supports the **Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis (DVSA)** module jointly organized by **Changi General Hospital (CGH)** and **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)**.

It contains a case study based on data from the **2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**, focusing on asthma prevalence and its relationship to demographic and behavioral factors. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Google Colab environment.
